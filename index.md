# Welcome

Hi, I'm Gunnar. Welcome to this central platform for my online presence.

I am a battery engineer, working on formation at Tesla.

Previously, I did a PhD in Steingart's Group at Columbia. There, my research was on ultrasound as a characterization technique for nascent battery chemistries.

Way before that, I majored in geophysics and worked in the geothermal power industry in my native Iceland. It's been a meandering path.
